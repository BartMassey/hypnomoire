# HypnoMoire
Copyright (c) 1998 Bart Massey

This is the earliest piece of Java code I wrote, back
in 1998.  It still compiles (albeit with some deprecation
warnings) and runs, though.

Hypnomoire puts up a "hypnotic" animated rotating-line
[mo&iuml;r&eacute; pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern)
display.  It runs as an applet, and uses AWT.

Sadly, the applet won't run on this page anymore, because
browsers no longer do Java applets. You'll need to run it
using the Java `appletviewer` via `appletviewer
hypnomoire.html`.
